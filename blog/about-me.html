        <h3>Welcome to my blog and thank you for visiting!</h3>
        <p>My name is Linh Pham and I am currently a student at Dev Academy in Wellington, training to become a web developer.</p>
        <p>I have had a varied work history including working in film and theatre, as an occupational therapist in mental health, and as a photographic technician and project planner in heritage imaging. I am now hoping to combine my varied skills and apply these to the world of tech. I am particularly interested in web accessibility and health-based applications of technology. </p>
