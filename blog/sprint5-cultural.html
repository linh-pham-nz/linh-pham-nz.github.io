        <h2>Sprint 5: Reflection on Core Skills</h2>

        <h4>3 new things I have learned about myself and my ego</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am very outcomes-focused and don't always acknowledge the process and how important that is for learning. I have high expectations of myself so if I don't reach a certain goal I am really disappointed. I am now trying to focus on having a Growth Mindset and reframe how I perceive outcomes and the effort and process involved to reach them.</li>
                <li>I don't back myself enough and acknowledge the skills I have. I focus on thinking about what I'm lacking and compare myself to others (in this case, my lack of technical skills). I don't believe and take on board the positive feedback I get, but this is due to my own self-doubt.</li>
                <li>I didn't realise that solving Javascript problems would give me such a sense of accomplishment!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>The most surprising things about the core learning</h4>
        <p>
            It surprised me how much emphasis there was on human skills when it comes to what employers are looking for in a developer. I had assumed that employers would be looking for technical skills and the best coders and therefore Dev Academy would focus on the technical skills needed to achieve this. 
        </p>

        <h4>The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h4>
        <p>
            Being honest about who I am and writing and publishing about myself to others. I am quite an introverted person so I found expressing myself in this way to be difficult so I spend too long on my cultural blog posts. But I am trying to work on portraying a more honest version of who I am as I get older. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Why does Dev Academy focus on core learning?</h4>
        <p>
            It seems that with determination anyone is able to become a coder - either through doing a course or teaching themselves. But whether people with the right values are doing the job and for the right reasons is another issue. We have come to a point with technology where we face serious issues with the ethics behind it (e.g. foreign agents actively influencing elections, malware, social media, facial recognition, privacy breaches...) and the effects of technology on our society are continually being questioned as it impinges on our democratic rights and affects our health and wellbeing in a negative way. I feel that tech is moving at a pace where our legislation is unable to adapt to keep up with it and work in a way to keep us safe. We therefore need to have diversity in technology to represent the population and not just people with good technical skills. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Does the time spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time?</h4>
        <p>
            No. It has reframed how I feel about learning and my idea of what failure and success is. I also think it's important to explore our values and reasons for wanting to become developers, to explore and develop an awareness of ourselves and our intentions. This model of learning has been very different from the ways that I have studied previously and has shown me that the traditional education model isn't necessarily the best way to do things.
