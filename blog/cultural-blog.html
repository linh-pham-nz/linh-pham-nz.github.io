        <h2>Sprint 1, Core 3: Identity & Values Exploration</h2>

        <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>

        <p>I was working on a psychiatric ward as an Occupational Therapist. There was a client of Asian descent who experienced paranoid schizophrenia. She requested that I be her OT. She had not been engaging with the other staff and nobody knew why. She asked to speak to me privately in her room one day and told me that she thought there was a conspiracy against her and that the prime minister and other politicians had abused their power and put her on the ward. For this reason, she didn't trust Pakeha people and believed they were going to lock up everyone else and she was warning me for my own safety. One of the symptoms of her illness was the experience of paranoid delusions, which was the case here. Another symptom is to lack insight into your illness and believe that you are not unwell. When I tried to reassure her that nobody was working against her, she would not believe me. I had to let her know that it was my duty to tell the rest of the care team about her beliefs as this was affecting her treatment, which she was very disappointed about.<p>

        <p>Although she told me her paranoid beliefs in confidence, I had to break this confidence and let the rest of the care team know about the delusions as this was affecting the care we were able to provide her. She felt betrayed by me and this affected our working relationship, however, letting others know what she was experiencing and being able to work as a team to help her was important and necessary for her recovery and discharge from the ward. I felt terrible because in her mind, these delusions were real and she had trusted me in talking to me about them. But for me, it was necessary to let my colleagues know what was happening with her in order to work as a team and make the best decisions for her as she did not have the ability due to her illness. Her care and recovery was more important than how she felt about me and the relationship between us and how I was feeling after the fallout.</p>

        <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
        
        <p>I was born in Vietnam but came to NZ when I was 9 months old. My parents are very traditional and had difficulty assimilating. They have very strong collectivist values, where the needs of the group are put before the needs of the individual. They are very selfless and work hard to help others. They grew up during the war and have worked very hard their wholes lives and with limited means. From my family and their culture, I have always appreciated what I have and have always looked for work in which I could contribute to society.<p> 
        
        <p>Growing up in NZ in an individualist culture has also influenced my values. I also want things for myself and see myself as an individual and work towards cultivating and strengthening who I am. For me, this has meant travelling and seeing the world, and trying to have as many different experiences as possible that I may have not had if I had grown up in Vietnam.</p>

        <p>These opposing sets of values are often in conflict and I often feel that I am stuck in a space in the middle of these cultures. I feel neither Vietnamese nor Kiwi. I am glad to be able to experience both cultures, but it makes life more complex and challenging.</p>

        <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>

        <p>Strengths: I am a very creative and practical person who is good at problem-solving in the physical world and I'm hopefully this will translate well to coding. I'm very hard working and have a good work ethic. Generally feel that I can complete a task if I put my mind to it and will persevere. Even though I knew nothing about coding at the beginning of the year, I wanted to be sure that it was something I wanted to do, so I started an online course and put in a lot of hours. When I want something, I go for it. I am very reflective and always questioning what has happened and why and what my role was in it and how I have influenced things. I reflect to understand what has passed and how I can improve the situation, myself and my actions, to have better outcomes.</p>

        <p>Limitations: these often have to do with how I feel about myself. I am very self-critical and suffer from perfectionism and imposter syndrome. I never feel satisfied with my work no matter how hard I try. I always feel that I could have done better, regardless of the positive feedback I get. I have difficult asking for help from others as I feel that I should know the answers and am very hard on myself when I don't. This will mean learning may take longer as I look for answers independently, rather than seeking them from others. When I struggle, imposter syndrome will kick in and I'll feel like I don't belong and I'm not meant to be here following this path.</p>
        
        <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>

        <p>I feel like my perseverance and creativity will be my strengths â€“ I will always try to keep going even though I may find things tough. I will try to see a problem from different angles and try to solve it in different ways, I will look at different ways to represent the problem and break it down and format it into a way that I understand. When this doesn't work, I will take a break, clear my mind, then return to it and persevere. When it comes to learning new concepts and processes involved with web development I feel these strengths will be most useful.</p>

        <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was
        resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>

        <p>I was working with a client on a forensic rehabilitation ward who had previously committed a knife crime whilst under the influence. She going to be moving from the ward (where there was 24 hour supervision) to a cottage on the grounds, which was similar to a flatting environment and with much less surveillance (this was the next step towards returning to living in the community). We had been doing some cooking sessions together to prepare her for this move as she wanted to start cooking for herself independently. Her main nurse felt that she wasn't ready to be using knives due to her previous crime and brought this up with me in passing. I explained to this nurse that it was important for her recovery as cooking was something she enjoyed and wanted to return to doing, as well as that she would be moving to a cottage and it would be difficult to control whether or not she used knives as they would be readily available to her. This reasoning had been previously documented in the notes and the rest of the team had discussed this at the multi-disciplinary team meeting. There was other reasoning involved but I did not have the time to explain this to nurse at the time as it was a busy ward. As well, there were some power dynamics between the nurse and myself as she was much older and had many years of experience on the ward, while I was a relatively new practitioner and had just started on the ward. This also made it difficult to talk to her.</p>

        <p>I don't believe the nurse was convinced as she brought up the issue another time as well. Looking back, I should have discussed this more in-depth with the nurse as we were seeing the issue from different perspectives. She was seeing this from a risk perspective, with the clients and staff in mind. I was seeing things from a client-centred perspective and wanted to advocate for the client's growth as a person and how she needed to progress and expand her community living skills for her recovery, and to do this there needed to be trust and positive risk-taking. There needed to be more conversation between myself and the nurse about our viewpoints, but due to the busy nature of the ward and the power dynamics, this made it difficult.</p>
