        <h2>Sprint 3: Emotional Intelligence</h2>

        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>

        <p>Emotional intelligence (or emotional quotient) refers to an individual's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express their emotions in a way that is beneficial for themselves and others. By being able to recognise and understand our own emotions as well as the emotions of others, we can use this awareness to guide thinking and behaviour in ourselves and those around us. We are not born with emotional intelligence, but much like a muscle, it can be trained and developed.</p>

        <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
    
        <p>IQ (or intelligence quotient) actually refers to an individual's score after taking a standardised intelligence test. Originally, the IQ test was used to identify students who would require specific educational assistance in order to ensure success at school. The measures of intelligence included:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Working and short-term memory</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
            <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
            <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although IQ was viewed by some as a standard measure of intelligence, criticisms included that the definition too narrow and that multiple intelligences exist that can more accurately encompass the full spectrum of human intelligence. Hence the development of concepts such as emotional intelligence. </p>

        <h4>Why is it important?</h4>

        <p>Having high emotional intelligence is necessary for communicating, relating to, and maintaining relationships with others; all of which are important in the workplace. Those who exhibit higher levels of emotional intelligence are more likely to have stellar performance and outstanding leadership in the work environment, as well as increased sense of happiness.</p>
